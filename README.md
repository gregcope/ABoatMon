Intro

A reimplementation, and extension of https://github.com/gregcope/piboatmon, as the original consumed too much power.  This is designed with the following goals; A) Be very low power and B) Chargable from 12V systems.

The present version is made from COTS parts to make life easy at the deign/proto stage.  However the code should be transferable.
